# Click-To-Play
final version of game

Click To Play was developed in 24 hours for the Minimalist Game Jam in Dundee.
The Team consisted of Programmers Elliot Morris & Nicholas Taylor with Artist Carl Packer.

The Builds can be found in the build folder. One executable and also web build (playable here: http://www.nicholastaylorportfolio.xyz/portfolio/click-to-play-1)

The scripts for the game are under assets/scripts. Much of the code for the game is based of the Abstract Class ClickToAct, with the actions the player can perform inheriting this base class.
I won't claim it's perfect, but it was certainly servicable for supporting our game with the time we had.

Hopefully, you enjoy the game, the experience and our sense of humour.
